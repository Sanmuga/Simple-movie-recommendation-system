# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a simple movie recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to suggest movies to users based on their historical movie ratings.

## How it works

The movie recommendation system is built using Python and leverages the `numpy` library for numerical operations. It takes into account a movie rating dataset (`train`) where each row corresponds to a user's movie ratings. The recommendation system uses a pre-trained predictive model (`model`) to estimate the ratings for unrated movies and then suggests the top N movies with the highest predicted ratings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy (install using `pip install numpy`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation.git](https://github.com/Sanmuga/Simple-movie-recommendation-system.git)
```

2. Ensure you have the required dataset (e.g., `train`) and the pre-trained predictive model (`model`) available.

3. Modify the code to include the list of movie names (`movie_names`) according to your dataset.

4. Run the movie recommendation script by replacing `<user_id>` with the ID of the user you want to get recommendations for:

```bash
python recommend_movies.py <user_id>
```

The script will print the top recommended movies for the given user.

## Example

```bash
python recommend_movies.py 25
```

Output:
```
Recommended movies:
- Movie A
- Movie B
- Movie C
```

## Note

Please make sure to update the necessary variables, such as `movie_names`, `train`, and `model`, according to your dataset and pre-trained model.

Feel free to experiment with different recommendation strategies or models to improve the movie recommendations further.
